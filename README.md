## About
This is my current progress on an os im writing for the LilyGo t-watch_S3 it requires you to first install the base software through for example PlatformIO
and requires necessary Libraries for the "Blackout" App from https://github.com/agrimpelhuber/esp8266-tvbgone to make sure there are compatible versions available there will be compatible versions in the lib folder
this is by no means complete and might never receive future updates so I implore you to make a fork and continue on your own. (some usefull sources for inspirateion are: https://100r.co/site/home.html for the emulator, and 
https://www.youtube.com/@StrangeLoopConf for some interesting insights about how to have fun coding)
